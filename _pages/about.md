I'm [Xiaonan](https://translate.google.com/?hl=zh-CN&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=潇南&op=translate), or Steve. I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html). My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research).

### Research Fields: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, Firm Dynamics. 
My research primarily focuses on the dynamics of labor and firms within frictional labor markets. By leveraging micro-data, I conduct empirical and quantitative investigations into how interactions between labor and firms impact the aggregate economy. In my job market paper, I examine the pecuniary motivations behind transitions using administrative data, and explore the role of stepping-stone employers in shaping earnings dynamics upon transitions.

### I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
