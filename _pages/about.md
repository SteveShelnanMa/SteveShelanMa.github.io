<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm [Xiaonan](https://translate.google.com/?hl=zh-CN&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=潇南&op=translate), or Steve. 
I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html). My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research).
</p>

### Research Fields: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, Firm Dynamics. 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research integrates empirical analysis with micro-data and search and matching theory. I investigate the dynamics between workers and firms within frictional labor markets and examine how their interactions shape the macroeconomy.

### I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
