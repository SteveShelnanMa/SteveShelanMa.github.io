I'm Xiaonan (pronouced [Hsiao-Nan](https://www.howtopronounce.com/hsiaonan#google_vignette)), or Steve. I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html). My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research).

### Research Fields: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, Firm Dynamics. 
I am particularly interested in the interplay between workers and firms, and how their interactions shape the labor market and the broader economy. 

### I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://SteveShelnanMa.github.io/CV/cv.pdf) updated on 09/01/2023.
